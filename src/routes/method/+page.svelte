The classifier emits a probability-like score; that score is evidence about acoustic similarity, not a calibrated probability that a particular dog barked.',
        'Each retained event has an audio clip and timestamps, so the automated result remains falsifiable by listening. The system performs no speaker identification, animal identification, direction finding or source localisation.

The Barktown learning happens on top of YAMNet's existing learning. This is called transfer learning. It lets us train a useful local detector with far fewer examples than would be required to build an audio model from scratch. An analogy would be hiring someone who already understands sound generally, then training them on the specific distinction that matters at this location.", 
      more: "Barktown uses YAMNet model as a sound-feature extractor: each short audio fragment is converted into a 1024-number “sound fingerprint” describing patterns YAMNet has already learned, such as rhythm, pitch and texture. Our labelled samples then train a much smaller Barktown classifier to interpret those fingerprints and learn the local distinction between bark/yap and everything else, with confusing negative examples deliberately included",

        'Audio is mixed to mono, resampled to 16 kHz and passed through YAMNet. Its overlapping analysis windows are approximately 0.96 seconds long with a 0.48-second step, each producing a 1024-dimensional embedding. The custom part is that Barktown then trains a small classifier that combines 128 learned sound patterns and produces a single score for how bark-like the audio is. During training, some signals are randomly hidden to reduce memorisation. Training stops when performance on held-back audio no longer improves. The final cutoff balances detected barks against false alarms, favouring fewer false alarms when undecided.'

      more: 'Recent sound is held temporarily in memory. A clip is retained only after several bark-like observations support one event, with a small amount of sound before and after it for context. A single high score is not enough. The detector asks for repeated evidence within a time window, prevents one bark from being counted several times and joins nearby barks into one session. When the session is over, it saves the surrounding audio and sends both the recording and its measurements to the archive.',

Current bootstrap defaults require a score of at least 0.92, four accepted hits within a 30-second sliding window and at least 1.5 seconds between counted hits. That minimum separation — called hit refractory in the code — stops overlapping analysis windows from double-counting barks.',

Audio objects live in S3-compatible MinIO storage; diary, annotation, detector-parameter and provenance records live in SQLite. The API is the persistent source of truth for live tuning, while checked configuration supplies validated first-boot fallbacks.',
